Twitter Sentiment Analysis

📌 Project Overview

In this hands-on project, we train a Naive Bayes classifier to predict sentiment from thousands of Twitter tweets. This project can be practically used by any company with a social media presence to automatically predict customer sentiment (i.e., whether customers are happy or not). The process can be automated, reducing the need for manual review of thousands of tweets and customer feedback.
